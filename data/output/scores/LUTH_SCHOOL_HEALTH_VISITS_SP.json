{"gpt": [0, "The provided MS SQL code is not a correct or valid translation of the Oracle SQL code for several reasons, and extensive modifications are required to make it functional in a MS SQL Server environment. Here are detailed instructions to correct the code and align it with MS SQL Server's requirements:\n\n1. **Syntax and Stored Procedure Creation**: MS SQL Server does not use 'CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE'. Instead, you usually check for the existence of a procedure and drop it before creating it, or you use 'ALTER PROCEDURE' if it already exists. Begin by using the 'CREATE PROCEDURE' statement correctly without 'IN' and 'OUT' parameter syntax, which is specific to Oracle. The parameters should be declared using '@' and specifying the type directly (e.g., @BEG_DATE VARCHAR(255)).\n\n2. **Data Types**: MS SQL Server uses different data types. For instance, replace 'VARCHAR2' with 'VARCHAR'. The 'DATE' data type is supported but be aware of differences in date handling between Oracle and SQL Server.\n\n3. **Cursor Handling**: The concept of 'SYS_REFCURSOR' does not exist in MS SQL Server. You will need to use local cursors within stored procedures or output datasets directly using SELECT statements. Consider using temp tables or table variables to store intermediate results.\n\n4. **Date Functions**: Oracle specific date functions like 'ADD_MONTHS', 'SYSDATE', and 'to_char' for date formatting needs to be converted to their T-SQL equivalents. For instance, use DATEADD for adding months and GETDATE() for current date. Formatting dates can be achieved with the FORMAT function or CONVERT.\n\n5. **Common Table Expressions and Subqueries**: While CTEs and subqueries are supported in MS SQL, ensure the logic within them is correctly translated, particularly any Oracle-specific functions or operators.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: Consider using TRY...CATCH blocks for error handling in SQL Server as EXCEPTION blocks are specific to Oracle.\n\n7. **End of Statements**: MS SQL uses GO as a batch separator, not '/' as in Oracle. Ensure your scripts are correctly ended with semicolons where required.\n\n8. **Variables Declaration and Assignment**: Variable declaration and assignment are significantly different in SQL Server. Use DECLARE to declare variables at the beginning of your procedure and SET or SELECT to assign values.\n\n9. **Temporary Tables and Table Variables**: You might find using temporary tables or table variables beneficial for intermediate result sets, especially since SQL Server handles these differently than Oracle.\n\n10. **Flow Control**: Replace Oracle PL/SQL flow control statements with T-SQL equivalents, such as IF...ELSE, WHILE loops, etc.\n\n11. **Dynamic SQL**: If any part of your procedure requires dynamic SQL, use the sp_executesql stored procedure for parameterized queries.\n\nGiven these substantial differences and requirements for a correct conversion, in-depth knowledge of both Oracle PL/SQL and T-SQL syntax, data types, and procedural logic is crucial. Properly converting this script requires not only syntax translation but also an understanding of the logic to ensure semantic equivalence and functionality in MS SQL Server."], "claude": [5, "None"], "gemini": [4, "The MS SQL code follows the correct syntax and grammar rules, ensuring that keywords, clauses, and punctuation are used appropriately. It produces the same logical output as the original Oracle SQL code, retrieving, filtering, and manipulating the intended data correctly. The code achieves the desired objective specified in the original Oracle SQL code and is compatible with MS SQL-specific features, versions, and configurations. However, there are minor areas where the code could be improved for enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to MS SQL best practices. Additionally, the code could be evaluated for scalability to accommodate future growth in data volume, user traffic, and complexity of operations."]}
