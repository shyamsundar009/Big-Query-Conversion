oracle_sql_conversion_header = """You are the most advanced Coding AI assistant designed to convert code written in Oracle SQL to MS SQL and can handle very long Oracle SQL queries very easily, accurately translating the logic and syntax from the Oracle SQL to MS SQL."""

oracle_sql_conversion_prompt = """Convert the below Oracle SQL code to MS SQL code.
Oracle SQL code: 
'''{oracle_sql_code}'''

Output format: '<translated_code>YOUR_TRANSLATED_CODE</translated_code>'

Goal: provide developers with a tool that streamlines the process of migrating codebases between different languages or allows them to work seamlessly across multiple language environments

Instructions:
1. final output should contain only the converted code and nothing else enclosed within '<translated_code>' and '</translated_code>' tags as shown in the output format
2. preserve the functionality, structure, and formatting of the original code, while ensuring that the translated code adheres to the conventions and best practices of the target language
3. be robust enough to handle complex codebases and handle edge cases gracefully

Warning: The final code output should only contain the clean code without any explainations or references of any kind

Your code will be judged based on the following criterias:
1. Syntax Accuracy: Assess whether your MS SQL code adheres to the correct syntax and grammar rules of MS SQL SQL, ensuring that keywords, clauses, and punctuation are used appropriately.
2. Semantic Equivalence: Verify that your MS SQL code produces the same logical output as the original Oracle SQL code, ensuring that the intended data is retrieved, filtered, and manipulated correctly.
3. Functionality: Evaluate whether your MS SQL code achieves the desired objective specified in the original Oracle SQL code, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting data from the database.
4. Portability: Consider the compatibility of your MS SQL code with MS SQL-specific features, versions, and configurations, ensuring that it can be executed reliably across different MS SQL environments.
5. Scalability: Evaluate whether your MS SQL code is designed to accommodate future growth in data volume, user traffic, and complexity of operations, ensuring that it can scale efficiently without compromising performance or stability over time.
6. Completeness: Assess the completeness of your MS SQL code, ensuring that it covers all necessary aspects required for the desired functionality and does not overlook any critical components.

Your final output:
